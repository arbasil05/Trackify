## Title of the Project
Trackify: A Web-Based Student Credit and CGPA Tracker

A web-based platform designed to help students, faculty, and administrators efficiently manage, track, and analyze academic credits in real time, ensuring alignment with institutional credit requirements and reducing manual workload.

## About
Trackify is a centralized academic credit tracking system that simplifies how students and institutions monitor academic credit progress. Manual tracking of credits across semesters can be cumbersome and prone to errors, especially when handling diverse course structures and elective systems.  

This project addresses these challenges by offering an intuitive web interface built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Students can view credit distributions across subjects and semesters, while administrators can input, update, and validate credit records. The system ensures transparency, accuracy, and easy data accessibility for all stakeholders.

## Features
- Implements a responsive MERN-based web application.  
- Secure authentication and role-based access (student and admin).  
- Real-time credit calculation and visualization.  
- Simplified data entry using Excel-like tabular input.  
- Auto-synchronization with MongoDB for record management.  
- Scalable backend with optimized RESTful APIs.  
- Analytics dashboard showing credit progress and completion status.  

## Requirements
* **Operating System:** 64-bit Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu for proper package compatibility.  
* **Development Environment:** Node.js v16+ and npm for building the application.  
* **Frameworks and Libraries:**  
  - Frontend: React.js with Material UI or Bootstrap for UI design.  
  - Backend: Express.js and MongoDB for API and database handling.  
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for version management and collaboration.  
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code for environment setup, debugging, and Git integration.  
* **Additional Dependencies:** Axios, Mongoose, JWT, dotenv, and CORS for full-stack functionality.

Credit Tracking Accuracy: 99.3%  
Note: These sample metrics can be updated with actual performance data after testing and deployment.

## Results and Impact
Trackify significantly reduces administrative effort in academic credit management by automating manual processes and minimizing errors. It empowers students to monitor their academic progress continuously, ensuring they meet graduation requirements on time.  

The system also aids institutes in generating quick reports and insights into overall academic performance, contributing to transparency, efficiency, and improved decision-making.
