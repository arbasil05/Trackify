## Title of the Project
Trackify: A Web-Based Student Credit and CGPA Tracker

A web-based platform designed to help students, faculty, and administrators efficiently manage, track, and analyze academic credits in real time, ensuring alignment with institutional credit requirements and reducing manual workload.

## About
Trackify is a centralized academic credit tracking system that simplifies how students and institutions monitor academic credit progress. Manual tracking of credits across semesters can be cumbersome and prone to errors, especially when handling diverse course structures and elective systems.  

This project addresses these challenges by offering an intuitive web interface built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Students can view credit distributions across subjects and semesters,  The system ensures transparency, accuracy, and easy data accessibility for all stakeholders.

## Features
- Implements a MERN-based web application.  
- Secure authentication.  
- Real-time credit calculation and visualization.  
- Scalable backend with optimized RESTful APIs.  
- Analytics dashboard showing credit progress and completion status.  

## Requirements
* **Operating System:** 64-bit Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu for proper package compatibility.  
* **Development Environment:** Node.js v16+ and npm for building the application.  
* **Frameworks and Libraries:**  
  - Frontend: React.js  
  - Backend: Express.js and MongoDB for API and database handling.  
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for version management and collaboration.  
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code for environment setup, debugging, and Git integration.  
* **Additional Dependencies:** Axios, Mongoose, JWT, dotenv, and CORS for full-stack functionality.
